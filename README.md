► Library Project:
---

This project provides a  Library System capable of managing book loans. Users, both administrators and non-administrators, interact with the system. Non-administrator users can browse the library's collection, check book availability, and loan books as needed. On the other hand, administrators have additional privileges such as monitoring loaned books, generating reports on stock availability, and overseeing the overall functioning of the library. With a focus on simplicity and functionality, this Library System streamlines the borrowing process for users while providing administrators with the tools necessary for effective library management.
